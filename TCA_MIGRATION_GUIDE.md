# TCA Migration Guide

## Changes Made

This document outlines the changes made to migrate the KidsVideo app to The Composable Architecture (TCA).

### 1. Dependencies Added
- Added `swift-composable-architecture` package dependency
- Updated Package.swift to include TCA

### 2. New Architecture Structure

#### Features Created:
- **AppFeature**: Root app state management, coordinates between menu and player
- **MenuFeature**: Manages menu state, background music, menu images, and navigation
- **PlayerFeature**: Manages video player state, content loading, and playback controls

#### Views Refactored:
- **AppView**: Root view using TCA store
- **MenuView**: Replaces ContentView functionality with TCA integration
- **PlayerView**: Player presentation with TCA state management

### 3. Data Model Updates
- **Channel**: Added `Equatable`, `Hashable`, `CaseIterable` conformance, added `jinan` and `chonan` cases
- **Content**: Added `Equatable`, `Hashable`, `Identifiable` conformance
- **MenuImage**: Added `Equatable` conformance for TCA state comparison

### 4. Dependency Clients
Created TCA dependency clients for side effects:
- **BackgroundMusicClient**: Handles background music playback
- **MenuImageClient**: Loads menu images
- **ConfigurationClient**: Loads app configuration
- **PlayerClient**: Manages video playback
- **ContentClient**: Loads video content data

### 5. Integration Points

#### Old vs New:
- **Old**: `ContentView` with `@State` and direct navigation
- **New**: `MenuView` with TCA Store and action-based navigation

- **Old**: Direct UIKit integration with callback-based communication
- **New**: TCA effects and dependency injection for side effects

### 6. Backward Compatibility
- Maintained existing PlayerViewController and PlayerViewControllerWrapper
- Preserved existing music and image loading logic
- Kept existing configuration system intact

### 7. Benefits Achieved
- **Testability**: All business logic is now pure functions in reducers
- **Predictability**: State changes are explicit through actions
- **Composability**: Features can be easily combined and reused
- **Debugging**: Time-travel debugging capabilities with TCA tools
- **Side Effect Management**: All side effects are handled through dependency injection

### 8. Next Steps for Further Improvement
- Consider migrating PlayerViewController to pure SwiftUI with TCA
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all features
- Implement TCA effects for more advanced player controls
- Add logging and analytics through TCA effects
